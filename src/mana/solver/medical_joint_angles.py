    [-180, 180] degrees and returns the fixed angles.

    Medical joint angles derived from Euler sequences only support a range
    form -180 to 180 degrees. Some motions, e.g. shoulder flexions or
    abductions may result in angles that exceed this range. As a result of this
    exceedance, the calculated angle will jump to the other end of the range
    (e.g. from 180 to -180). As this issue affects other analytical parts of
    exercise evaluations, the range must be exceeded manually. Therefore, this
    function uses a defined threshold to detect abrupt changes of joint angles
    and interprets them a range exceedance. Depending on the type of exceedance
    (from -180 to 180 XOR 180 to -180) 360Â° degrees are added to/subtracted
    from the exceeding joint angles.
